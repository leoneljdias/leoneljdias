# Leonel Dias - Software Developer & Project Manager

With over ten years of experience in software development, including research at INESC, I’ve had the opportunity to work on diverse web and software applications at **3Maps**, across sectors like Municipalities, Regional Governments, and Ports. 

Currently, at **APDL**, I am focused on creating and managing digital and web solutions that drive efficiency and innovation at the **Ports of Leixões**, **Viana**, and **Douro**. My background in **Informatics Engineering** from **FEUP** enables me to lead projects that not only meet but exceed expectations.
