# About Me  

**I'm a software engineer.** I’m the creator of **Geoglify**, a side project where I experiment with innovative ideas and test solutions for logistics and mapping. It’s my playground for creativity, where I turn concepts into practical applications using **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MapLibre**.

I'm building the future of digital web solutions to make port logistics smarter, focusing on geospatial technology and streamlined operations at **Port of Leixões**.

Outside of work, I enjoy **swimming**, **cooking**, playing **PlayStation**, watching **documentaries**, and exploring quiet **parks** and **beaches**. I’m always on the lookout for inspiration in the simplest things.
