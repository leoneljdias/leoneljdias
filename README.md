# Hi! I'm Leonel Dias

I’m a software developer and project manager at Porto de Leixões. I love working with websites, maps, and technology to help make ports smarter. My focus is on web mapping, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and spatial technologies to improve port operations. I enjoy solving problems and using technology to make things better.

I created [Geoglify](https://geoglify.com/) to explore creative ways of showing map data. It’s not just a project—it’s my way of exploring new ideas in map technology. I am always learning new technologies like Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and map tools like Leaflet, MapLibre, and more. I enjoy learning and adding new tools to my skills.

In my free time, I like swimming, walking, exploring beaches, cruising, playing PS5 games, cooking, and watching movies and series.
