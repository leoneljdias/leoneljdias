# Hi! I'm Leonel Dias

I’m a software engineer who loves creating great web experiences. I work with web mapping, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and spatial technologies. My main goal is to improve smart port solutions. I enjoy solving problems and finding new ways to use technology to make things better. I’m always excited to take on new challenges and work on projects that make a difference.

I created [Geoglify](https://geoglify.com/) to find creative ways to show geographic data. Geoglify is not just a project—it's a journey into exploring new ideas in geospatial technology. I am always learning new technologies like Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DeckGL, Leaflet, MapTalks, MapLibre, and more. I love learning and keep adding new tools to my skills.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, long walks, exploring beaches, cruising, playing PS5 games, cooking, and watching the latest series, documentaries, and movies.
