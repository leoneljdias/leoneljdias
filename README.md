# Hi! I'm Leonel Dias

I'm a passionate software engineer dedicated to creating amazing web experiences. I focus on web mapping, GIS, and spatial technologies, and I'm committed to improving smart port solutions.

Currently, I'm working on Location-Based Web Apps at 3Maps. I've worked on various projects like 3Maps, 3Shorex, 3NavPlanning, and 3Park, pushing the limits of what's possible in the digital world.

I'm the creator of [Geoglify](https://geoglify.com/), where I explore creative ways to visualize geographic data. With a passion for innovation and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of geospatial technology, Geoglify is more than just a projectâ€”it's a journey into the heart of exploration.

I'm always learning technologies like Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DeckGL, Leaflet, MapTalks, MapLibre, and more. My quest for knowledge drives me to continually expand my personal toolkit, ensuring that I am always equipped with the latest technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, taking long walks, exploring beaches, cruising, playing PS5 games, experimenting with cooking, and watching the latest series, documentaries, and movies.
