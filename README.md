# Hi! I'm Leonel Dias

I am a software engineer who loves making great web experiences. I focus on web mapping, GIS, and spatial technologies to improve smart port solutions. Currently, I am working on Location-Based Web Apps at 3Maps. I have worked on projects like 3Maps, 3Shorex, 3NavPlanning, and 3Park, always trying to push the limits of what is possible.

I created [Geoglify](https://geoglify.com/) to find creative ways to show geographic data. Geoglify is not just a projectâ€”it's a journey into exploring new ideas in geospatial technology. I am always learning new technologies like Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DeckGL, Leaflet, MapTalks, MapLibre, and more. I love learning and keep adding new tools to my skills.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, long walks, exploring beaches, cruising, playing PS5 games, cooking, and watching the latest series, documentaries, and movies.
