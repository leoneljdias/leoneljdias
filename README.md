Hey, I'm Leonel Dias!

I was born in a small town in north of Portugal and have always been fascinated by maps and technology. I enjoy solving real-world problems using web tools and geotechnology.

Right now, I’m working on projects at APDL (Port Administration of Douro, Leixões, and Viana do Castelo), where we make port management smarter and more efficient. My work is a mix of software development and project management, always focused on finding simple solutions for complex challenges.

I also believe in open-source and the power of communities to create real impact.
