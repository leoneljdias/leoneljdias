# Hi! I'm Leonel Dias

Software developer and project manager. I make websites and use tech to make ports smarter. Simple as that. 

Currently at APDL (Port Authority of Douro, Leixões and Viana do Castelo at Portugal), diving into Logistics Single Window and Geo applications. 

I've worked on projects that transform ports into modern hubs. I started [Geoglify](https://geoglify.com/) to showcase map data like never before. It’s more than just a project; it’s my playground for new ideas. Always learning: Laravel, Vue.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and map tools like Leaflet and MapLibre. The journey never stops.

Outside of work, you'll find me swimming, gaming on my PS5, cooking up a storm, or binge-watching movies, series, and documentaries. Life's about balance.
